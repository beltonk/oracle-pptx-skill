# Oracle PowerPoint Guidelines

## Slide Design and Functionality

### Customizing Your Slides

- This template was designed as a net-new template, improving upon slide layouts and accessibility; you will need to re-build slides in this new template and not copy/paste slides.
- Avoid major changes to slide design (font size, color, element placement); the slides are designed to look harmonious together.
- Mix and match slides as needed, using your judgment on which work best for the content.

## Font Used

- Oracle Sans Tab family.

## Required Oracle Sans Tab Font

- Oracle Sans Tab Regular.
- Oracle Sans Tab Bold.

# How to Use This Deck: Speaker Slides

## Large Live Events

1. Primarily use dark slides; light slides are still included for compatibility with other templates.
2. Use speaker slides without headshots; when speakers are shown live on stage, do not use headshots on slides.
3. Present and edit in the PPT desktop app, not SharePoint in the browser.

## All Uses Outside Large Live Events

1. Mix dark and light slides as needed.
2. Use speaker slides with headshots for virtual events.
3. Present and edit in the PPT desktop app, not SharePoint in the browser.

# Presentation Strategy Update

## Themed Slides

### What Pages Will Be Themed?

- Cover.
- Section dividers.
- Speaker.
- Quote.
- Impact statements.
- Closing/thank you.
- Expect updates to these slides for events like Oracle AI World.

## Standard Content Slides

### Why Are We Doing This?

- Content focused: interior pages are mostly blank so content is the primary focus.
- Cross-template compatibility: a simplified interior means less work when translating decks between templates.

# Accessibility

Tips for building inclusive slides:

## Screen Reader–Friendly Slides

- Build slides that work well with screen readers for low/no vision users.
- Choose "Arrange" from the Home tab, then "Selection Pane".
- The selection pane lists objects; a screen reader reads from the bottom item to the top.
- Correct any items that are out of order by dragging them to the correct position.

## Alt Text for Images

- Right-click an image and choose "View Alt Text".
- Describe the object for someone who is blind or low vision, or mark as decorative.

# How to Use This Deck: Footer

## How to Use the Footer

- The copyright appears at the bottom of each slide in the same position, except the title and closing slides.

### Footer Text Colors

- Light slides: Neutral 140 (`#514C47`).
- Dark slides: Neutral 70 (`#AEA8A2`).
- Only change the copyright year; ensure it is always current.

## Customizing the Footer

- The footer has a copyright portion and a confidential portion.

### Public Event Presentations

- Remove the pipe `|` and everything to the right.
- Example: `Copyright © 2026, Oracle and/or its affiliates`.

### Confidential Presentations

- Keep the confidentiality portion and customize as needed.
- Delete designations that do not apply (Internal, Restricted, Highly Restricted). Example:
  - `Copyright © 2026, Oracle and/or its affiliates | Confidential: Highly Restricted`.
